- Move the game to networking (client-server) architecture (again)
- Implement character creation
- Add mobs with proper AIs
- Implement entity saving for worlds
- Refactor everything in com.stabilise.opengl because everything in there is frankly horrible (LibGDX?)
- Add gameplay features!
- Refactor everything in com.stabilise.sound because I've suddenly decided its setup is more complicated than it needs to be

DONE
- Implement a sound system
- Refactor WorldLoader and WorldGenerator such that they use ExecutorService for thread delegation
