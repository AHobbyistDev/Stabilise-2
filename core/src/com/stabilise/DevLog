Project Start to 05/12/13 (Specific dates unknown/can't be bothered to dig up)
	- Simple tile classes
	- Simple rendering
	- Simple menu
	- Simple slices
	- Simple superimposed sine wave worldgen
	- Simple entity logic
	- Log
2013/12/06
	- Added NBT
	- Improved menu button focus management
2013/12/14
	- Fixed an annoying error regarding binding textures and sprites not working
2013/12/16
	- Added TCPConnection.java and basic packets
2013/12/17
	- Beginning migration of worlds to saved worlds
	- Beginning migration of game to client-server architecture (not really - just creating relevant classes in advance)
2013/12/19
	- Added TextBox.java
	- Added the ability to create and select worlds
2013/12/20
	- Added support for fonts with lowercase letters
	- Added world creation via the main menu - saves world info file
	- ButtonGrid.java is now ComponentGrid.java
2013/12/21
	- Added slice saving and loading
	- Initial implementation of regions
	- Began shift to networking architecture (all code is now broken - hooray!)
2013/12/22
	- The server and client can now be set up and both can send packets to the other
	- Made first successful client-server interaction
2013/12/23
	- The worlds are now ordered based on the most recent time they were used.
	- Game ported over to (probably unstable) client-server architecture
		- Worlds can now run on 'servers' (WOOHOO!)
	- Bug where regions aren't unloaded because slices are still marked as loaded for some reason
2013/12/24
	- Fixed regions not unloading (turned out to be buffered slices being re-requested even though they're technically loaded)
	- Removed secondary main thread and client thread - they were just redundant
2013/12/25
	- Refactored accessors for better immutability practices and whatnot
	- Potentially ensured the list of connections for a server remains concurrent
2013/12/27
	- Rewrote the log to make it instance-based.
2014/01/06
	- Added shapes which use SAT (separating axis theorem) collision detection
2014/01/07
	- Beginning rewrite of entity physics - extremely agitated by difficulty in doing so
2014/01/19
	- Entity physics complete (WOO!) (still a possibility for future breakages, though)
2014/01/20
	- Added Animation.java
2014/01/21
	- Added MovementController.java
	- Changed texture groups/owners to generic marker objects
2014/01/25
	- Initial framework for concurrent world generation
2014/02/01
	- Added generalised VertexBufferObject classes (modularised/neatened VBO management stuff)
2014/02/02
	- Added coloured rectangles (for backgrounds and stuff)
2014/02/07
	- Worlds now generate on a separate thread
2014/02/08
	- Added the ability for structures to generate across region boundaries
		- Adding structures to already-generated regions currently doesn't work (sometimes... I think)
2014/03/13
	- Can add other entities to the world (client-only, very crude)
		- Still todo:
			- Sync them between the client and the server
			- Have them save to the world
			- Better methods for referencing and managing them
2014/03/14
	- Added hitboxes
	- Added projectiles
2014/03/15
	- Added arrows, which the player can fire by pressing F

2014/03/26
	- Added ConfigFile.java
2014/03/27
	- Added player inventory

	- Added an in-game pause menu
	- Added support for different colour alpha values
2014/04/02
	- Added shader support
2014/04/04
	- Found a bug where having the item hotbar filled messes with the font texture
2014/04/05
	- Fixed the texture breaking bug - it was interference from non-textured shapes and glDisable(GL_TEXTURE_2D). This fixing involves lots of enabling and disabling of GL_TEXTURE_2D. May impact performance.
2014/04/08
	- Refactored fonts
		- Added FontStyle.java
2014/04/10

2014/04/11
	- Added mass dummy enemy summoning by pressing T
	- Added arrow burst by pressing R
	- Tidied up entity and hitbox management - entities are added to and removed from the world at the end of each tick
2014/04/15
	- Improved rendering performance for spritesheets and fonts
2014/04/18
	- Mobs flash white when they take damage, and turn red when they die

2014/04/23
	- Remade main menu
		- Select world screen is now much more fancy
			- Yet to reimplement world creation
	- Fixed a highly annoying bug where unloading a VBO crashes the game if it is still attached to a shader
2014/05/11
	- Added a basic player model consisting of a spritesheet of poses
	- Improved mob states - a mob's state can now determine how it is capable of acting
		- The player model renders poses based on the player's state and how long they have remained in that state
2014/05/16
	- Added MobController architecture
2014/05/17
	- Updated player animations/poses
		- Slides
		- 3 standard attacks, 3 special attacks (side, up, down)
			- Attacks currently don't do anything gameplay-wise
2014/05/18
	- Added hitboxes for the 3 standard attacks
2014/05/27
	- Added aerial attacks and special moves

	- Enemies no longer drop items
	- Item hotbar is no longer displayed as a part of the HUD

	- Added fireballs
		- Fireballs apply a fire effect to mobs they hit, which deals damage over time
	- Added fire particles
	- Added smoke particles which appear when a mob dies
2014/05/29
	- Player health, stamina and mana now regen over time
	- Shooting fireballs consumes mana, and they cannot be shot without sufficient mana
	- Enemies now randomly spawn in the world
2014/05/30
	- Added hitboxes for all attacks and special attacks
2014/06/02
	- Added the ability to delete worlds
2014/06/06
	- Reimplemented the ability to create worlds
		- Worlds with a negative seed will, for now at least, be flatland, while positive seeds produce hilly worlds
2014/06/09
	- vSync is now turned on by default
	- The game now pauses when the window loses focus
	- The game now returns to the main menu if it encounters an exception during a game tick, as opposed to simply crashing
2014/06/16
	- Added the 'how to play' menu
2014/06/17
	- Changed the map of regions in GameWorld from HashMap to ConcurrentHashMap to prevent ConcurrentModificationExceptions being thrown when it is accessed by the world generator thread (hopefully prevents some in-game crashes)
2014/06/20
	- Attempted to make region transfer between threads safer and less error-prone (main thread now grabs generated regions once generator thread stops)
	- The fireball cast by the aerial down special now destroys non-blast resistant tiles within a small radius
	- Grass now spreads to exposed dirt tiles
2014/07/04
	- Perlin noise world generation
		- The terrain curve is now completely random, never repeats, and looks nice
		- Cave generation which uses 2D perlin noise
	- Improved synchronisation and resource exchange between the main, loader and worldgen threads
		- Regions now have an 'unsavedChanges' flag which allows the main thread to take control of most world saving
		- Modifications to the world (e.g. destroyed terrain) are now saved
2014/07/07
	- Cave generation now uses 2D simplex noise
	- Added zoom
	- Menus ignore the mouse cursor if the user is using keyboard navigation
2014/07/09
	- Improved region/slice/tile referencing
	- Added tile entities
		- Added a chest tile entity, which stores items
		- Infrastructure is still crude and incomplete
			- Tile entities currently cause the game to crash when a world is generated with them
			- Tile entities cause the game to crash when they are destroyed
2014/07/10
	- Tile entities no longer cause crashes
	- Chests drop their contents into the world when they are destroyed
2014/07/21
	- Added the ability to place tiles using the mouse
2014/07/25
	- Improved entity/particle rendering
	- Added tile items (though they don't render properly yet)
2014/08/06
	- Improved the speed of collision detection by making shapes precompute their projection axes and projections rather than do so at every collision
2014/08/24
	- Tiles and Items are now backed by a registry instead of an array
2014/08/28
	- Added the SoundManager (no sounds actually in use yet)
2014/09/14
	- Added translational interpolation for MenuItems
2014/09/23

2014/10/03
	- The world now remembers the player's last location and spawns them there
2014/10/05
	- Moved the WorldGenerator/Loader architecture to use a thread pool, I/O and gen operations are now much faster
2014/11/22
	- Added Profiler.java
2014/12/10
	- Projection precomputation for shapes in util.shape is now an optional optimisation
2014/12/14
	- Ported to libGDX. Everything is broken!
2015/01/07
	- Added InstantiationRegistry to create entities, tile entities, packets, etc.
2015/01/10
	- Porting World architecture over to something more extensive and usable for all world types (e.g. singleplayer, server, client to a server)
2015/01/15
	- The game is now runnable to an extent. Menu architecture is still broken, rendering is crude and incomplete, and only one sample world can be run.
2015/12/11
	- Preparing architecture to add multiple dimensions.
2015/02/12
	- Added NBTExporter to automatically convert objects to and from NBT

2015/06/15
	- RegionCache is now RegionStore and is now in charge of managing all regions.
2015/09/21
	- Game now uses the updated floatarray hitboxes.
2015/09/28
	- Added FragList and improved general collections classes
2015/10/20
	- Replaced util.concurrent.Task with the util.concurrent.task framework
2015/11/06
	- Extremely basic lighting implementation
2015/11/11
