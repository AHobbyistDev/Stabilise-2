TOP PRIORITY
- Menus
- Get multidimensional worlds working
    - Step 1: Refactor region loading architecture
        * Must allow for loading a region of another dimension, and being notified
          when that region is fully loaded and active.
         DONE
    - Step 2: Basic portal
        * Simply transports entities to a different dimension.
        * Must handle moving entities between dimensions properly and robustly
        * If possible do this while planning ahead to full portal impl
         SKIPPING STRAIGHT TO FULL PORTAL
    - Step 3: Full proper portal
        * We shall see
- Character model

HIGH PRIORITY
- Entity saving in worlds
- Proper world loading/unloading akin to what RegionStore does for regions
- Improve entity physics
    - Allow one-way collisions (e.g., platforms)
    - Allow collisions with portals, so you can't only partially be in a portal
    - (Possibly allow sloped tiles)

TODO EVENTUALLY
- Structure generation
- Prepping spawn
