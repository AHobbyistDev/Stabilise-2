TOP PRIORITY
- Character model

HIGH PRIORITY
- Menus
- Entity saving in worlds
- Proper world loading/unloading akin to what RegionStore does for regions
- Improve entity physics
	- Fig bugs
    - Allow one-way collisions (e.g. platforms)
    - (Possibly allow sloped tiles)

TODO EVENTUALLY
- Structure generation
- Prepping spawn
- Either abuse weak references or get the world's particle manager to deregister its event listener.
