TOP PRIORITY
- Get multidimensional worlds working
    - Step 1: Refactor region loading architecture
         DONE
    - Step 2: Portal
         IN PROGRESS
- Character model
    ON HOLD

HIGH PRIORITY
- Menus
- Entity saving in worlds
- Proper world loading/unloading akin to what RegionStore does for regions
- Improve entity physics
    - Allow one-way collisions (e.g., platforms)
    - Allow collisions with portals, so you can't only partially be in a portal
    - (Possibly allow sloped tiles)

TODO EVENTUALLY
- Structure generation
- Prepping spawn
