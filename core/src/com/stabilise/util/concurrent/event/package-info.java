/**
 * This package centrally features the
 * {@link com.stabilise.util.concurrent.event.EventDispatcher EventDispatcher}
 * class, which allows the user to register listeners for
 * {@link com.stabilise.util.concurrent.event.Event Event}s to be invoked
 * whenever such events are dispatched/posted.
 *
 * <p>This package is inspired by <tt>EventDispatcher</tt> from the
 * <tt>ActionScript3</tt> language.
 *
 * <p>(I consider this to be a good package -- small, straightforward, and
 * provides powerful and flexible functionality.)
